# Connect Test - Client

This is a basic client written in `ReactJS` that was taken from `steadweb/frontend-technical-test`. It contains the "client" part of the application, which splits the client and server into separate applications. This application was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The purpose of this application is to demonstrate applications should follow SRP (Single Responsiblity). The original test contained both the client and server as one package.

## Prerequisites

- Node 12.x
- Npm 6.x
